# Transformer_based-SCAMs-detector

Both the DLS and Assay folders contains:
-Their respective dataset
-DeepSCAM model
-Isolation moel
-Random forest model of SCAM detective
-Re-implementation of the deep neural model of SCAM detective
-Re-implementation of the ISE model
-Our transformer model 
-119 molecular descriptor for extracting features used by the Ise model
-The t-SNE plot of the features learned by our transforer model 

We note that in the ISE folder, running the 42-base notebook is sufficient alone as it will run the other nessecary files.
